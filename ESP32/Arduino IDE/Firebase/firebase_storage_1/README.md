# Firebase Storage

- Firebase Storage can be used to store files likes images, documents etc.

- First we authenticate as the registered user using the credentials, then we 
establish connection to firebase storage/

- Once connection is established i.e the tokens are accepted and verified, we can upload or download files to the path mentioned.

- Once uploading, the download path will be assigned using random web url address, under the storage path node.
